# Project_FODA
An investigation into various forms of regression applied to power curves of wind turbines.

# Description:
Linear regression, followed by logistical regression on a given power curve, with some experimentation along the way.

The project is well annotated, so I will refrain from explaining too much here.

At the start I reversed the coefficients. I fixed this and this gave me a better simple linear regression model.

I could not find a way to fit the parameters for the V80 or any other Wind Turbine's parameters to the dataset given.
The max output of the given dataset was roughly 1/20th the value of almost all other WT's. 
When I inputted what I thought were the parameters based on the given dataset into the equation, the results turned out very well.

The last section is the discovery process that occured before I decided to change the parameters. I put all relevant results before the Bibliography.

My hope was to remove the 0 values and clean the dataset, but the aforementioned issues took up too much time. I still think it's important to recognise that they were there.
